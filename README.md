Learn everything you need to build any SAAS product in a very organized, ordered, and self-paced learning roadmap based on experience!

![screely-1621816127208](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50620277/120562655-7ddb2700-c40f-11eb-94db-c64e100f2953.png)

### Basic Steps for Full Stack Web Developer

1. Learn Basic of:
   - HTML
   - CSS
   - JavaScript
2. Develop Simple Project using these technologies to understand how does the website actually work.
3. Choose any 1 Front-End Technology:
   - React JS
   - Vue JS
   - Angular
4. Along with Front-End we need to study Back-End also:
   - Java
   - Python
   - C#
   - Ruby
   - Php
   - Node JS
5. We need databases to store the data:

- SQL
  - MYSQL
  - SQL Server
  - Oracle
  - Postegre SQL
- NOSQL
  - MongoDB
  - Casssandra
  - CouchDB

6. Then we have different versions of the developed software with some changes, so we use:
   - Git
   - GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket
7. Finally we need one of the Cloud Services to host the website:
   - Google Cloud Platform
   - Microsoft Azure
   - Amazon Web Service
   - Heroku
8. Some containers used in Cloud Services:
   - Docker
   - Kubernetes

## Once we prepare all these aspect for a particular project we can get a hang of Full Stack Web Development.
